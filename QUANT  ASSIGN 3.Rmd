LETS SAY :
LARGE SIZE PRODUCTION PLANT S = P
MEDIUM SIZE PRODUCTION PLANTS =Q
SMALL SIZE PRODUCTION PLANTS =R

Objective Function MAX Z = 420P+360Q+300R
To be Precise Z = 420(P1+p2+p3)+360(Q1+Q2+Q3+300(R1+R2+R3)
CONSTRAINTS
CAPACITY CONSTRAINT
P1+Q1+R1 ≤750

P2 + Q2 + R3 ≤ 900

P3 + Q3 + R3 ≤ 450
LETS TAKE STORAGE CONSTRAINT

20P1 + 15Q1 + 12R1 ≤ 13000

20P2 + 15Q2 + 12R2 ≤ 12000

20P3 + 15Q3 + 12R3 ≤ 5000
LETS TAKE SALE CONSTRAINT

A1 + A2 + A3 ≤ 900

B1 + B2 + B3 ≤ 1200

C1 + C2 + C3 ≤ 750
